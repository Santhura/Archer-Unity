# Archer-Unity

This project is made to create mechanics for a Third-Person Character.
This will be focussed on using bow and arrows.

Later other mechanics will be introduced. but first the character controller is going to be implemented.


At the moment the character model and animations are from https://www.mixamo.com/#/
other assets come from https://assetstore.unity.com/
